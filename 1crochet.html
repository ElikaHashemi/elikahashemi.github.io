    <h1> 1. What is Crochet? </h1>
    <p>Crochet is a crafting practice that involves using a hook to create fabric from yarn or thread. Its origins are somewhat uncertain, but it is believed to have originated in the Middle East, where it was used to create lace-like fabrics. By the 1800s, crochet had spread throughout Europe, where it was used to create intricate doilies, table runners, and other decorative items. Crochet was particularly popular during the Victorian era, when it was seen as a refined and genteel activity. </p>
